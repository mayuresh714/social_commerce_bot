# social_commerce_bot
this is the miniproject done by me with 5 college friends for intercollege startup idea presentation competetion called 'THE ORIGINAL PITCH'

basically our idea was to develop suitable and customer friendly chatbots that can give digital presence to small shops,service centres

My contribution was to develop the logic,workflow and deployment of the bot.the whole code is in python so it is easy to understand it.
The design and workflow of this chatbot is very simple (frankly no NLP models are used here).
